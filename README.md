The **CoolKid'sBadge** is a convention electronic badge created for the [LeHack2024](https://lehack.org/fr/) Cyber-security convention in Paris(Fr) (not affiliated), containing an **ESP32S3** with 16Mb Flash, a **NRF24L01** Slot, a **FlipperZero** interface, 7 **LEDs** and some pads. It can be powered directly from the **GPIO** Port of the FlipperZero, or via the **USB C** Connector.

## History

This project started by 2023, but could not be ready in time for LeHack2023. So the project continued live on twitch at https://twitch.tv/tixlegeek

## Compiling

The ESP32S3 firmware needs to be compiled using espressif's **ESP-IDF v5.2** and higher.

##¬†Using the badge

First, connect the power supply, either the FlipperZero with 5V GPIO enabled, or using the USB C Port.

You should be able to connect to the CoolKid'sBadge using the procedural password you got, or generated using the [dedicated script.](https://github.com/tixlegeek/CoolKidsBadge-2024/tree/main/fw/scripts/wifiPassword)

Once connected, navigate to https://192.168.4.1 to start using your Badge like a Cool Kid you are üòé

## Tools

The **CoolKid'sBadge** comes with a lot of little tools aimed towards Prototyping, Reverse engineering... But it's still a conference badge :)

- **WiFi Configuration:**

  - **STA**
  - **AP** (always ON, enabling Configuration)

- **i2C Tools**

  The embedded I2C Tool allows you to scan devices. It also allows you to write and read registers from any I2C components.

- **LED configurator**

  LED animation can be chosen using the embedded tool, in the LED menu.

- **GPIO**

  There's 10 GPIO Pads on the rear of the badge, that can be monitored and controlled using the GPIO Tool.
